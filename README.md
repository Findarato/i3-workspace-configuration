# i3 configuration

Heavily inspired by/pilfered from [CopperBadger's dotfiles](https://github.com/CopperBadger/dotfiles).


## Installation + Usage

Dependencies are:

* [lemonbar-xft](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lemonbar-xft-git/)
* Python3
* The [i3ipc library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/i3ipc) via pip (it's also available [via the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/i3ipc-python-git/)).
* [Conky](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/conky-git/)
* [Font Awesome](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/otf-font-awesome/) (I recommend [`xfd`](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/xorg-xfd/) for browsing icons)
* [Noto Sans](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ttf-noto/) is the default font, feel free to switch it out in `i3_lemonbar_config`


To run the lemonbar, simply run the included `i3_lemonbar.sh` script.

This Lemonbar setup is by GitHub user **electro7**. I've made several personal
changes to get my system and theme, but you should check out his original repo
